# northbricks-banking-starter-app
This is a ionic2 hyrbid app that connects to Northbricks platform to utilize banking services on PSD2.

##  Getting started
Our goal is to enable developers and third-party providers to connect to banks easily and utilize their today closed services. 

Our slogan is - "One API to rule them ALL". With that we mean that we are going to connect banks and you as a developer should be able to use it easily.

See our swagger and how an API is built from ground up:
