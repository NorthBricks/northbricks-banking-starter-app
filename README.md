##  Getting started
Our goal is to enable developers and third-party providers to connect to banks easily and utilize their today closed services. 

Our slogan is - "One API to rule them ALL". With that we mean that we are going to connect banks and you as a developer should be able to use it easily.

### Conntected banks
- Nordea (11 million customers)

### Soon to be onboarded
- OP Bank Finland [https://uusi.op.fi/]
- Länsförsäkringar 
- SEB
- ICA
- And of course....all other banks in Europe


### 5 minutes connect to banking service
1. Install node.js and GIT
2. run from command prompt `npm install cordova -g` `npm install --save @ionic-native/core@beta`
3. git clone https://github.com/NorthBricks/northbricks-banking-starter-app.git
4. Go into directory created by GIT clone. 
5. `npm install`

We wanna make it possible for third-party to consume
  banking services in 5 minutes.
